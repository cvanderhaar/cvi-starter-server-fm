# IBM IoT for Automotive (SaaS) - Fleet Management Starter Application

The Fleet Management Starter Application for the IBMÂ® IoT for Automotive SaaS offering demonstrates how quickly you can build an app on IBM Cloud to manage and monitor a fleet of vehicles in real time.

## Overview

The Fleet Management Starter Application uses the IBM IoT for Automotive SaaS offering together with IBM Cloud services to provide a sample solution for fleet operation management and personnel. By using the application,  you can easily track and view the following information:

- Availability of a fleet of cars on a map
- Location of vehicles
- Overall health of the entire fleet
- Health diagnostics and conditions of a specific vehicle in the fleet
- Condition of vehicles by order of severity or risk
- Event history for the entire fleet
- Event history for a specific vehicle in the fleet

The Fleet Management Starter Application uses the following IBM Cloud services:

- [Cloudant NoSQL DB](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/)
- [Secure Gateway(Optional)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/secure-gateway/)
- [IBM Watson IoT Platform (Optional)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/internet-of-things-platform/)

## Prerequisites
To deploy and use the Fleet Management Starter Application, you need an instance of IBM IoT for Automotive that is deployed and running on either IBM SaaS.

## Deploying the app

Deploy the Fleet Management Starter Application on IBM Cloud either automatically or manually, as outlined in the following instructions.

### Automatically deploy the starter app on IBM Cloud

3. Clone the Fleet Management Starter Application to your local environment by using the following console command:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iota-starter-server-fm-saas.git
  ```
4. Change to the directory that you created.
5. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the values of `<name>` and `<host>` to something unique. `<host>` must be same with `postUrl` in gateway.properties.

  ```
  applications:
         :
    host: iota-starter-server-fleetmanagement
    name: iota-starter-server-fleetmanagement
    memory: 512M
    path: .
    instances: 1
         :
   ```
   Note: The host value is used to generate your application URL, which is in the following syntax:
   `<host>.mybluemix.net`.

6. Install the NPM package by using the following command. The installer observes the dependencies that are specified in your `package.json` file.
  ```
  $ cd ./webclient
  $ npm install
  ```
7. Convert TypeScript to JavaScript:
